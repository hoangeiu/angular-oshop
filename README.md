# Oshop
- In this project, I practice developing a website using Angular. I created this website to manage food ingredients and also provide a shopping cart to add items and purchase them.
- I study many new thing from Angular: the basic concept of Angular, databinding, directive, services and injection, routing, Observable (Subject), control Form, pipes, making http requets, authentication, dynamic components (ngIf & modalRef), evironments, lazy loading and deploy Angular app.

Key-features: Angular(10) features and Firebase.
